# Deployment

You should probably onedr0p/cluster-template instead of this repository. If you choose to continue you have my condolences.

## Pre-requisites

### Development environment

Your dev environment should be set up automatically once you have cloned the repository.

### Nodes

Each of the nodes must have Talos installed on it before you can continue.

## Deployment

Run `task bootstrap:up` to begin the bootstrapping process. With luck it should complete after a while and you'll have a functioning cluster.
