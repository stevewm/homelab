# ðŸ’¾ NAS

The NAS is an ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 with 6x2TB NVMe drives.

## Stacks

Each folder in `nas/stacks/` contains a Stack definition in the form of a Docker Compose file.

### Deploying new stacks

New stacks currently require ClickOps to deploy in Portainer. Once deployed they are automatically updated on a timer directly from the repo.
